# Library

## This project will allow me to get practice with JS objects, event listeners and modals

I have created what I had in mind and I worked with more than I expected. It took me a while to understand when to use an object constructor. It was not til I realized I can decrease my lines of code using objects that I understood how to implement them.

### Things I didn't expect to take away

- Gathering form values and using them in JS
- Updating a table DOM
- Using CSS Grid to style the table

### Future updates

1. I was using half a screen when styling; so I'm going to have to adjust for large screens
2. Make a check box that is filled if read
3. If read is checked - remove the book or add it to read library
4. Add storage
